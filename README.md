# Course Registration System

## Overview

The Course Registration System aims to streamline course planning by providing easy access to essential course prerequisite information for students. As fellow students, we have experienced the significant challenges posed by the current manual process of checking prerequisites and accessing course availability across different platforms. This often leads to information mismatching, confusion, and frustration during registration preparation.

Our project, the Course Registration System, is designed to help all the college students overcome these hurdles while pursuing academic excellence. The current website involves tedious manual checks of course prerequisites, resulting in time-consuming and cumbersome experiences. Additionally, accessing information about course availability in specific sections lacks the desired seamlessness, requiring students to switch among multiple platforms to gather the necessary information for course planning. Recognizing these challenges, the goal of the Course Registration System is to provide a comprehensive solution that revolutionizes the course planning experience.
